## task scheduler
Create an asynchronous task scheduler. Define a set of tasks, each with a specified execution time. Implement a scheduler that runs these tasks concurrently, ensuring they start execution at the scheduled time. Use asynchronous programming concepts to achieve this, and consider handling potential exceptions during task execution.
