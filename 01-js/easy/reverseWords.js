/*
  Implement a function `reverseWords` that takes a string as input and reverses the order of words in the string.
  A word is defined as any sequence of characters separated by spaces.

  Example:
  Input: "Hello World"
  Output: "World Hello"

  Once implemented, you can test your code by running
  - `npm run test-reverse-words`
*/
function reverseWords(inputString) {
    // Your code here
    return "";
}

module.exports = reverseWords;
